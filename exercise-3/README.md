# Exercise-2

As described in [module-4](https://github.com/INFO-201/m4-git-intro), you should begin by forking this repository, then cloning it to your local machine (if you haven't already).

In the space below, you'll provide some information about a terminal command you've learned thus far in the class. In particular, you should include the following:

A `heading` with the name of the command
An example of how it can be used (with appropriate code highlighting)
A _nested list_ of information about the command (i.e., things that it does, or how it can be used)

See `complete` branch for answers.

# git clone #
``` Git clone brings the repository down from the repository on git hub onto your local machine. This is the start of each project we have done so far ```

* It can be used to clone repositories 
  * It allows you to edit the master branch
  * potentially allows you to create branches
* I'm not entirely sure what else it does
  * It's really freaking cool though.
